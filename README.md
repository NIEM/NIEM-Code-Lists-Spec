# The NIEM Code Lists Specification

This document establishes methods for using code list artifacts with NIEM
information exchange specifications. It provides for the use of Genericode
documents, as well as for CSV code lists. It supports the use of code lists at
run time and at schema definition time. It also includes identifiers for
well-known columns that have semantics needed across the NIEM community.

This specification is currently under development. Comments are welcome, and
should be directed either in email to
[niem-comments@lists.gatech.edu](mailto:niem-comments@lists.gatech.edu?subject=NIEM Code Lists Specification),
or as an issue at https://github.com/NIEM/niem-code-lists-spec/issues.

Development of version 1.0 of this specification is being tracked in [the dev-1.0
branch](https://github.com/NIEM/niem-code-lists-spec/tree/dev-1.0).  (The "readme" branch just holds this README file)

For more information, see [the NIEM website's code lists
page](http://niem.github.io/technical/code-lists/).
