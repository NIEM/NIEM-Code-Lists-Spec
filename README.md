# The NIEM Code Lists Specification

This document establishes methods for using code list artifacts with NIEM
information exchange specifications. It provides for the use of Genericode
documents, as well as for CSV code lists. It supports the use of code lists at
run time and at schema definition time. It also includes identifiers for
well-known columns that have semantics needed across the NIEM community.

Comments on this specification are invited; please submit comments as [issues on this
repository's issues tracker](https://github.com/NIEM/NIEM-Code-Lists-Spec/issues).
