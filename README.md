# The NIEM Code Lists Specification

This document establishes methods for using code list artifacts with NIEM
information exchange specifications. It provides for the use of Genericode
documents, as well as for CSV code lists. It supports the use of code lists at
run time and at schema definition time. It also includes identifiers for
well-known columns that have semantics needed across the NIEM community.

The latest release of the specification, version 1.0, may be viewed on
[reference.niem.gov](https://reference.niem.gov/niem/specification/code-lists/1.0/niem-code-lists-1.0-2016-06-20.html). All
files that come with the specification are provided in
[the "releases" branch of this repository](https://github.com/NIEM/niem-code-lists-spec/tree/release).
(You are viewing the "readme" branch, which only holds this README file)

Comments on this specification are welcome, and should be directed either in

Code Lists Specification), or as an issue at
