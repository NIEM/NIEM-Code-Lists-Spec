This document establishes methods for using code list artifacts with NIEM information exchange specifications. It provides for the use of Genericode documents, as well as for CSV code lists. It supports the use of code lists at run time and at schema definition time. It also includes identifiers for well-known columns that have semantics needed across the NIEM community.
